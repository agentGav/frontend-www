At that time, I had just started my masters studies at the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/prospective-pg/msc/mit\">University of St Andrews</a> and stumbled upon a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxhR0o0cXFs\">YouTube clip</a> of Gavin Starks, newly appointed CEO of the ODI. In a lightning talk he briefly outlined the ODI&rsquo;s research agenda and its general openness towards interested external researchers. A couple of months later, I was able to leave the Scottish countryside for four weeks to work as a research intern at the ODI offices in Shoreditch, London. There, suddenly thrown into the vibrant heart of European Open Data, I tried to answer my dissertation&rsquo;s research question: How have different stakeholders influenced the development of the British Open Data Ecosystem?</p>\n\n<p>My research question emerged from a variety of previous attempts to generalise on the strategies that have been used to implement and sustain Open Data initiatives. There are many different, but overlapping, guidelines. At the World Bank, for example, an <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/open-government-data-toolkit\">Open Government Data Working Group has developed a Toolkit</a> to help governments launch their own initiatives. The United Nation&rsquo;s Public Administration Programme, in turn, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://workspace.unpan.org/sites/Internet/Documents/Guidenlines%20on%20OGDCE%20May17%202013.pdf\">maintains guidelines</a> on how to use Open Government Data for citizen engagement. Finally, the OECD published <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/open-government-data_5k46bj4f03s7-en\">a framework</a> on how to conduct further empirical analyses of Open Government Data initiatives. A common denominator found across these and similar reports is that the promises of economic prosperity and civic empowerment can only be achieved in a well-established network of different stakeholders. With my work at the ODI, I therefore developed a descriptive case study of the British Open Data ecosystem as one of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://census.okfn.org/G8/\">“best in class”</a>. When I came to London I not only expected to answer my academic research question, but also hoped to design a subsequent and longitudinal analysis of an ecosystem&rsquo;s structural properties.</p>\n\n<p>My initial research contained a review of existing attempts to define what constitutes an Open Data ecosystem. On the one hand, I was looking for a model broad enough to include all relevant actors, while on the other hand this model had to be specific enough to be operational in my field research.</p>\n\n<p>I finally developed a framework based on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedKingdom/Local%20Assets/Documents/Market%20insights/Deloitte%20Analytics/uk-da-open-growth.pdf\">an assessment of Open Data in the UK</a> produced by Deloitte. Here the “traditional” Open Data value chain – from supplier through intermediary to consumer – is enhanced with a shortcut, as well as a feedback-loop. To include stakeholders, which do not interact with the data directly but play a significant role in the maintenance of the ecosystem, I added ecosystem enablers to the model as a separate stakeholder class. This category pools actors (like investors, academics and policy makers) who seem quite heterogenous at first glance, but in fact all play their own role in the network of an Open Data ecosystem. </p>\n\n<p>During my time at the ODI I used this taxonomy as a checklist to guide my research. With semi-structured interviews as my main source of data, I made sure to engage with at least one representative from each stakeholder category. To cover the supply side, I met with representatives from the Cabinet Office, as a proxy for public data holding bodies. I spoke with several startups (which transform Open Data into products and services) about their roles as intermediaries, and I met with various data consumers during Open Data meetups around London. An interview with Martin Tisné from <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.omidyar.com/\">Omidyar Network</a> helped me to understand the role of impact investors within the ecosystem and a long discussion with Rufus Pollock shed light on the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://okfn.org/\">Open Knowledge Foundation&rsquo;s</a> role in the last decade of Open Data implementation in the UK. During my time at the ODI I managed to conduct 15 interviews in total, which I turned into roughly 13,000 words of transcribed text that I subsequently coded and analysed. </p>\n\n<p>Together with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/fredsaunderson\">Fred Saunderson</a>, who conducted his <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/guest-post-shifting-environments-at-the-odi\">masters research</a> on open participation at the ODI as well, I intend to publish the final results of my dissertation within the coming months. </p>\n\n<p>My time at the ODI sparked my interest in the underlying structures and organisational routines of Open Data ecosystems and demonstrated to me the demand of further research that exists in this field. To address this demand I recently moved to Berlin to begin my PhD research on municipal Open Data ecosystems at <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/\">Free University</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in my previous or future research, you can follow my <a href=\"www.heimstaedt.com\">research blog</a> or contact me directly on <a href=\"&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#046;&#104;&#101;&#105;&#109;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#101;&#100;&#116;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;\">&#109;&#046;&#104;&#101;&#105;&#109;&#115;&#116;&#097;&#101;&#100;&#116;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.images.cdn.fotopedia.com/flickr-5625707813-original/Photography_Techniques/Depth_of_field/Shallow_focus/Research.jpg\" alt=\"Alt\" /></p>\n\n","media_enquiries_name":"","media_enquiries_email":"","media_enquiries_telephone":"","alternative_title":"","organizations":[],"author":{"name":"Max Heimstädt","slug":"max-heimstadt","web_url":"http://www.dev/max-heimstadt","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[]},"author":{"name":"Max Heimstädt","slug":"max-heimstadt","web_url":"http://www.dev/max-heimstadt","tag_ids":["writers"]},"nodes":[],"organizations":[],"related_external_links":[]},{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/entering-the-age-of-open-data-business.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/blog/entering-the-age-of-open-data-business","slug":"entering-the-age-of-open-data-business","title":"2014:  Entering the age of open data business","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-04-25T09:33:55+01:00","created_at":"2014-03-10T09:56:10+00:00","tag_ids":["blog"],"tags":[{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/tags/articles/blog.json","web_url":null,"title":"Blog Post","details":{"description":"Blog Post","short_description":null,"type":"article"},"content_with_tag":{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/with_tag.json?article=blog","web_url":"http://www.dev/browse/blog","slug":"blog"},"parent":null}],"related":[{"id":"http://contentapi.dev/how-make-business-case-open-data.json","web_url":"http://www.dev/guides/how-make-business-case-open-data","slug":"how-make-business-case-open-data","title":"How to make a business case for open data","format":"article","updated_at":"2014-04-25T09:33:36+01:00","created_at":"2013-02-21T09:32:10+00:00","tag_ids":["guide"]}],"details":{"need_id":null,"business_proposition":false,"description":"ODI Commercial Director, Stuart Coleman, is featured in the Spring 2014 issue[ Data IQ magazine](http://www.dataiq.co.uk) giving his insight on the future of open data in business:\r\n","excerpt":"","language":"en","need_extended_font":false,"url":"","content":"<p><img src=\"http://bd7a65e2cb448908f934-86a50c88e47af9e1fb58ce0672b5a500.r32.cf3.rackcdn.com/uploads/assets/1d/8c/531d8c7ff362be6c870000cb/square_SRC-ODIimage.jpg\" alt=\"null\" class=\"img pull-right\" id=\"attachment-531d8c7f1f986a3e26000022\" /></p>\n\n<p>ODI Commercial Director, Stuart Coleman, is featured in the Spring 2014 issue<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.dataiq.co.uk\"> Data IQ magazine</a> giving his insight on the future of open data in business:</p>\n\n<p>2013 saw sustained industry hype about big data that also conflated and confused the domains of personal data and open data, all at a time when the debate over data privacy raged at a global level. Although there are<a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/data-definitions\"> important differences between the three &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; of data</a>, there is also a rich ecosystem of ideas, innovation and ultimately\nsocial and commercial opportunity emerging in the spaces where they overlap.</p>\n\n<p>But how do businesses make returns with open data? The answer begins by mining it! Consider Climate Corporation’s massive disruption of the US farming insurance market and subsequent £1bn exit at the end of last year. Its business began with <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://e-pluribusunum.com/2013/10/03/digging-in-the-open-data-dirt-climate-corporation-finds-nearly-1-billion-in-acquisition/\">‘digging about in open data dirt’</a> and convened the smartest Silicon Valley data scientists (co-incidentally exploiting the same <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://wit.io/posts/clojure-all-grown-up\">clojure</a> tech stack as our very own <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com/\">Mastodon C</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Surely other parts of the insurance industry are ripe for similar transformation? I would love to see open environmental, social and economic data combine with telematics data to help sort out the stale <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2012/oct/05/wheels-come-off-car-insurance-premiums-going-up\">mess</a> that UK car insurance premiums are in.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a space where personal data privacy could be really be debated. Imagine a dynamic monthly insurance premium fluctuating in line with risks assessed using open data sources and personal driving data - <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://telematicsnews.info/2013/03/04/41423_m4043/\">Citroen</a> is already looking at this. So open data is there to be used, for social, environmental and economic gains.</p>\n\n<p>The business case for publishing open data is gathering momentum. For example, our June 2013 research <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/\">Show me the money</a> (carried out in collaboration with the Bank of England) brought to the fore (and the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a03efee-ed3a-11e2-ad6e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2rih0H4Ta\">\nfront page of the FT</a>) a showcase example. Using anonymous aggregate customer data\nsourced from the three largest UK peer-to-peer lending businesses, we proved a healthy market has been developing throughout the downturn, serving the needs of consumers and small businesses at a time when traditional lenders are not.  </p>\n\n<p>For those businesses leading new financial services, open data offers a credible and highly defensible path to <em><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2298979\">&lsquo;data intensive but prescriptively light&rsquo;</a></em> regulation, providing consumers and investors with a deeper level of transparency and an opportunity to invest with greater confidence. Open data applied more broadly in finance has huge potential to help businesses keep nimble, honest and highly competitive. Let’s hope that 2014 sees the growth of more open finance and raises the transparency bar.</p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://smtm.labs.theodi.org/\">\nShow me the Money</a> is an example of how greater openness might deliver competitive advantage in one sector but there are multiple reasons why for profit businesses can and should publish open data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Openly outsourcing research and development: a unique, fast and inexpensive way to get your hands on expert outside help.<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.kaggle.com/\"> Kaggle</a> is using this approach in data science to investigate information challenges and opportunities. Look to reward and engage people for finding opportunities and errors. (Not everyone has a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/microsoft-rewards-100000-to-hacker-for-internet-explorer-bug-issues-update-429743\">$100,000</a> prize fund like Microsoft, but incentives work on a smaller scale too!).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data procurement: as Nike opened up their supply chain data, their reputation improved and suppliers became more competitive on price and quality. In the same way that governments open data, businesses could open up their spending data. There would be no need to name the suppliers but the market could use the data freely to compete.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data product data: publishing product information as open data can help to extend and better syndicate the reach of products and services making it easier for partners and customers to embed, link to and curate company data.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Open data reputation: publishing frequent and relevant data on a company’s business activities helps to prove it is serious about being a better citizen.  </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>2014 will be a year when more big businesses embrace openness. The question they will need to address is not whether they should publish open data but how and when. I look forward to helping them find the answers!</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Stuart Coleman is Commercial Director of the ODI.
